# 🏠 Home Credit Default Risk – EDA Project

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze data from the **Home Credit Default Risk** competition hosted on **Kaggle**. The aim is to assess the financial reliability of loan applicants and understand which factors contribute most to the risk of default. This analysis serves as a foundation for building predictive models that can estimate the likelihood of a client having repayment difficulties.
